Ok, I&#8217;ve decided to start recording my daily activities for a number of reasons. 

<div>
  <ol>
    <li>
      My supervisor requires me to give a list of projects that I worked on along with the amount of time that I saved for someone each year. This should make that task a little easier and more accurate.
    </li>
    <li>
      This should give me a better idea of what I am accomplishing each day.
    </li>
    <li>
      Hopefully this would be a good reference to answer the oft asked question of WTF was I thinking.
    </li>
    <li>
      It has the potential of being interesting to me or maybe someone else at some point in the future.
    </li>
    <li>
      Because if everyone else jumped off the empire state building I&#8217;d prolly follow them without too much hesitation&#8230;. ah maybe not it HAS taken me quite awhile to even consider jumping on the whole &#8220;I&#8217;m so awesome I blog&#8221; fad. Is it conincidental that I recently bought my wife an iPhone and think the thing is cool? I&#8217;ve questioned my hetrosexuality ever since.
    </li>
  </ol>
