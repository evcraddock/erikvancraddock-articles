so on the way home from work yesterday Nathan and I decided to stop smoking. I had two cigarretes left and it was about 4:30. I smoked the first one immediately after driving off after dropping him off at his house. I smoked the 2nd one at about 7:30 last night. I&#8217;ve been losing my mind ever since. By the way it should be noted that I got a text message from Nathan saying that he was not going to quit. I&#8217;m still going to. I promised I would quit before the baby is born and am going to do it. Enough bout that.
